# 🏡 ALX Airbnb Clone Backend Documentation

This repository contains all the **design, specification, and documentation** materials for the the backend of the **Airbnb Clone** project, built under the ALX curriculum.  

> **Note:** This repository is focused on documentation — system requirements, user stories, API specs, architecture diagrams, etc. The actual backend code may live in a separate repository or folder.

## 🎯 Project Vision

The goal of this project is to build a robust, scalable backend for an Airbnb-like platform, enabling users to:

- Register as guests or hosts  
- List, edit, and delete property rentals  
- Search and filter properties  
- Create, manage, and cancel bookings  
- Integrate payments (guest payments, host payouts)  
- Leave reviews and ratings  
- Receive notifications  
- Enable admin oversight of users, listings, and transactions  

This documentation repository captures the planning, architectural design, and specification steps before—or alongside—coding.

## 📘 Documentation Highlights

- **Project Requirements** — Core, technical, and non-functional requirements defined at a high level.  
- **User Stories** — Behavior-driven descriptions (“As a user, I want to…”) based on use case interactions.  
- **Use Case Diagram** — Visual diagram showing actors (Guest, Host, Admin, Payment Gateway, Email Service) interacting with system features.  
- **Detailed Requirements (requirements.md)** — API specs, validation rules, input/output schemas, performance goals.  
- **Feature Overview / Architecture** — (If included) Diagrams and descriptions of module interactions, database layers, external dependencies.

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alphakeem-Adroit/alx-airbnb-project-documentation.git
    ```

2. View / edit diagrams

   * Open `.drawio` files in [diagrams.net / draw.io]
   * Export to PNG or PDF for sharing

3. Read the specs

   * Start with `project-requirements/README.md`
   * Move into `requirements.md` for deeper technical details
   * Refer to user stories for behavior-focused context

4. Iterate

   * As features evolve, update specs, diagrams, and stories
   * Use this documentation as a reference during backend code development

## 📌 Tips for Maintaining Quality

* Always version your API (e.g. `/api/v1/…`) so changes don’t break backward compatibility
* Keep diagrams in sync with the spec documents
* Add date/version logs in your markdown files
* Use consistent naming, formatting, and structure
* Review spec changes before implementing them
